The script automatically tracks the chapters you read on MangaDex. A chapter is set as Unfinished (yellow eye icon) as soon as you open it in the reader, and then set as Read (green eye icon) when you reach the final page of that chapter.

You can toggle between the Unread/Unfinished/Read statuses by clicking on the eye icon. On a manga's main page, you can also set several chapters to a specified status at once.
